# Event-Ticket-Management-System-with-Blockchain
Developed a blockchain based ticketing system to prevent fraud and ensure transparency.
Event ticket management is an essential part of event planning that ensures efficient
ticket sales and distribution. However, traditional ticketing systems are often marred by issues
such as ticket scalping, counterfeit tickets, and lack of transparency. Blockchain technology, with
its decentralized and secure nature, offers a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
proposes an event ticket management system with blockchain implementation, where each ticket
is represented with unique digital token on the blockchain. The system ensures that each ticket
can only be sold once, eliminating the problem of ticket scalping and ensuring that the ticket
purchaser gets a genuine ticket. Furthermore, the system provides transparency and auditable
data on ticket sales and distribution, thus enhancing accountability and preventing fraudlent
activities. The proposed system also includes asmart contract that automatically executes the
terms of the ticket purchase agreement, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing
transaction costs. Overall, the proposed system offers a secure, transparent, and efficient solution
to event ticket management.
